# Weekender

This is an ERC20 token WKR.

It has an inflation of 2% every weekday. This is applied on an hour per hour basis

It has a deflation of 5% during both Saturday and Sunday.

Therefore it has a neutral interest rate per week. However, it pushes users to attempt to spend token approaching the weekend and accumulate tokens before the inflation periods or early in the inflation periods.

It has been built using the truffle and ganache libraries.
